I know that I’m destined for greatness 
I’m simply that kind of a guy.
And while my great feats will be many,
I will start with the world’s greatest pie!

Really it should be quite simple 
there isn’t much room for mistake,
I throw in the flavors that I like the best
and mix each component with all of the rest
then it goes in the oven to bake,
it goes in the oven to bake!
